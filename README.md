# zLayer-Modal-AngularJS
zLayer is a lean and feature-rich modal for AngularJS.

## The Idea

The goal of zLayer is to be a lean modal window that has the features required to run in a complex web application environment. Despite it being lean, it is designed to be feature-rich, smart, and have an API that allows the user to quickly see results. It has been designed with web applications in mind and has features to match. The content of each zLayer modal window can load its own HTML partials and model data. Each window can also interact with the context of the element that launched it. This is useful for doing things like opening a modal to request data which in turn changes the contents of an input field, etc.
